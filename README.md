# Open_AI_Twitter_Bot
This is a POC twitter bot that uses Open AI to generate a tweet. 

You will need to add your creds for both twiiter and the openai api in a config.py file in this format

ck = "Consumer key" cs = "Consumer Secret Key" at = "access token" ats = "access token secret" oik = "openai api key"
